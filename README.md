# EvadeGameDesktop

A Desktop Implementation of the Evade Game.

### Installing

* Clone the repository with the 'git clone' command.
(Additionally, there are a number of dependencies on the jokrey.utilities.animation package(another repository), so clone that into the path also)
* Download one of the releases (possibly easier)
* Download the android app (see repo Evade_AndroidApp for source code)

## Features

 * Playing the game

## Usage

Not that hard tbh. Just move the mouse and let the ball that follows it evade the incoming objects.
